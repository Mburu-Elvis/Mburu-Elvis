Hi there 👋, I'm Elvis Mburu!

I'm an enthusiastic Backend Developer and Data Nerd with a strong foundation in building scalable systems, REST APIs, and working with data-driven applications. I enjoy diving deep into system design, optimizing backend performance, and solving complex problems that make people's lives easier.
🔭 What I’m working on:

    Wallet System Project: As part of the Natujenge 2024 cohort challenge, I'm building a wallet system that allows users to perform financial transactions like deposits, payments, and transfers.
    Mobile Wallet Application: A Java-based project, 'mobileWallet', deployed with Docker and services like PostgreSQL.
    Rolax Water Monitoring Project: A real-time water quality monitoring system, designed to track water metrics (e.g., pH, temperature, and turbidity). This project uses IoT sensors and a backend that processes and visualizes the data, ensuring easy monitoring of water supply for communities.
